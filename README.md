# Maps


Creating a visualization of restaurant ratings using concepts of machine learning (K- means clustering) through Unsupervised Learning from the Yelp academic dataset. 

Segements the City of Berkeley, CA into regions, where each region is shaded by the predicted rating of the closest restaurant (yellow is 5 stars, blue is 1 star). Specifically, the visualization is constructed in a Voronoi diagram and is measured your preference and predicted rating, based on your geographic location.


K- means clustering is used to find groups which have not been explicitly labeled in the data. The color of the dot is determined by the restaurant's location. For example, Downtown Berkeley restaurants are colored green. The user that generates this map has a strong preference for Southside restaurants, and so the southern regions are colored yellow.
